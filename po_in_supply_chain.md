In Nike's supply chain, **PO** typically stands for **Purchase Order**. A purchase order is a commercial document issued by a buyer to a supplier, indicating types, quantities, and agreed-upon prices for products or services. 

### Context in Supply Chain:
1. **Order Management**: PO serves as a formal request from Nike to its suppliers or manufacturers for goods or materials needed in the production and distribution process.
2. **Tracking and Reconciliation**: PO numbers are crucial for tracking orders, ensuring delivery timelines, and matching invoices with shipments.
3. **Inventory Planning**: POs help maintain inventory levels, ensuring that stock aligns with demand forecasts and sales targets.
4. **Compliance and Auditing**: They are often used for compliance with financial and legal standards, as well as for auditing supply chain operations.

If you're encountering "PO" in another specific context at Nike, it could have a specialized meaning based on the system or department.
