In Palantir Foundry, **ontology** represents the structured, semantic layer that organizes and connects data within the platform. It allows users to define a consistent framework of objects, their attributes, and relationships, creating a shared language for datasets, pipelines, and applications.

### **Building Ontology in Foundry**
An ontology in Foundry starts with defining **object types**, which are essentially entities like "Customer," "Order," or "Machine." Each object type can have attributes (e.g., "Customer Name" or "Order Date") and relationships with other object types. These definitions help integrate datasets with a unified schema for downstream analysis and applications.

**Steps for Creating Ontology:**
1. **Define Object Types**: Use Foundry's Ontology Manager to create object types that represent real-world entities.
2. **Add Attributes**: Assign properties to each object type, such as numeric, text, or categorical data.
3. **Set Relationships**: Link object types to represent interactions or dependencies.
4. **Map Data**: Connect raw datasets to the ontology through pipelines.

### **Example of Ontology Construction**
- **Object Types**: 
  - `Order` (Attributes: Order ID, Date, Total Amount).
  - `Customer` (Attributes: Customer ID, Name, Email).
  - `Product` (Attributes: Product ID, Name, Price).
- **Relationships**: 
  - `Order` relates to `Customer` (One-to-Many).
  - `Order` relates to `Product` (Many-to-Many via Order Line Items).

### **Using Ontology for Downstream Applications**
Once the ontology is built, it can be utilized for:
1. **Workshop Applications**: Filter and visualize objects based on their attributes and relationships.
2. **Action Framework**: Perform actions on objects (e.g., update order status or assign tasks).
3. **AI Models**: Enhance ML workflows by leveraging structured relationships and metadata.
4. **Dashboards**: Build insights-driven dashboards showing interconnected data.
