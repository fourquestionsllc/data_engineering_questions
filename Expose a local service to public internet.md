If you want to expose a service running on your laptop (like a web server or API) to the **public internet**, the easiest way is to use a **tunneling tool** that forwards external traffic to your local machine. Here are some **free tools** you can use:

---

### ✅ **1. Ngrok (Freemium)**
- One of the most popular tools.
- Creates a secure tunnel to your local port.
- Free tier allows HTTP/HTTPS tunnels.

**Steps:**
1. Download from [https://ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com).
2. Install and authenticate:
   ```bash
   ngrok config add-authtoken <your_token>
   ```
3. Start a tunnel:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
   (if your service runs on port 8000)

4. You’ll get a public URL like:
   ```
   https://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```

### ✅ **2. LocalTunnel (Completely Free)**
- Simple and open-source alternative.
- No signup required.

**Steps:**
1. Install it globally (Node.js required):
   ```bash
   npm install -g localtunnel
   ```
2. Run it:
   ```bash
   lt --port 8000
   ```
3. You’ll get a public URL like:
   ```
   https://happy-mole-21.loca.lt
   ```

### ✅ **3. Cloudflare Tunnel (Free, secure, stable)**
- Formerly called Argo Tunnel.
- Very reliable and secure.
- Requires setting up a Cloudflare account + domain (can use free domain from Freenom if needed).

**Steps:**
1. Sign up at [https://cloudflare.com](https://cloudflare.com).
2. Install `cloudflared`:
   ```bash
   wget https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/releases/latest/download/cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cloudflared-linux-amd64.deb
   ```
3. Login:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel login
   ```
4. Create a tunnel:
   ```bash
   cloudflared tunnel create my-tunnel
   cloudflared tunnel route dns my-tunnel myservice.yourdomain.com
   cloudflared tunnel run my-tunnel
   ```

### ✅ **4. Teleport (for secure access to internal resources)**
- [https://goteleport.com](https://goteleport.com)
- More enterprise-focused but has a free open-source version.
