A `.twb` file in Tableau is an XML file that stores the workbook structure, including views, filters, data sources, and formatting. You can extract the view's filters using Python by parsing the XML structure.

### Steps to Extract Filters:
1. **Read the `.twb` file as an XML document.**
2. **Find the `worksheet` elements** that define different views.
3. **Locate filter elements** (e.g., `<filter>` or `<calculation>` inside worksheets).
4. **Extract relevant attributes** such as field name, filter type, and values.

### Python Code:
```python
import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET

def extract_filters_from_twb(file_path):
    tree = ET.parse(file_path)  # Load the XML tree
    root = tree.getroot()
    
    namespaces = {'tab': 'http://www.tableausoftware.com/xml/workbook'}  # Define namespace if needed
    
    filters_data = []
    
    for worksheet in root.findall(".//worksheet"):
        sheet_name = worksheet.get("name")  # Get worksheet name
        filters = worksheet.findall(".//filter")
        
        for filter_elem in filters:
            field = filter_elem.get("column")  # Get the field being filtered
            filter_type = filter_elem.get("filter-type")  # Type of filter (e.g., categorical, range)
            filters_data.append({"worksheet": sheet_name, "field": field, "type": filter_type})

    return filters_data

# Example usage:
file_path = "your_workbook.twb"
filters = extract_filters_from_twb(file_path)

# Print extracted filters
for f in filters:
    print(f)
```

### Explanation:
- **Parses the XML structure** of the `.twb` file.
- **Finds all worksheet elements** to extract filters from each view.
- **Retrieves filter information**, such as the column (field) and filter type.
- **Prints extracted filters** for analysis.

#### Next Steps:
- If your `.twb` contains **calculated filters**, you might need to search for `<calculation>` or `<datasource-filter>`.
- If Tableau's XML uses a **namespace**, adjust `namespaces` in `findall()`.
- To extract filter values, look for **child elements** inside `<filter>`.
