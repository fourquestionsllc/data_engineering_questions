To remove duplicates from a table in Databricks and save the results back to the same table, you can use a `CREATE OR REPLACE` statement with a `ROW_NUMBER()` or `DISTINCT` approach. Here's an example using `ROW_NUMBER()`:

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a temporary view with deduplicated data
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW deduplicated_table AS
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY column1, column2, column3 ORDER BY id_column) AS row_num
    FROM original_table
) subquery
WHERE row_num = 1;

-- Step 2: Overwrite the original table with deduplicated data
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE original_table AS
SELECT column1, column2, column3, id_column -- Include all necessary columns
FROM deduplicated_table;
```

### Explanation:
1. **`ROW_NUMBER()`**:
   - This function assigns a unique number to each row within a partition of data based on `PARTITION BY` columns (those used to identify duplicates).
   - Only the first occurrence (`row_num = 1`) of each duplicate group is kept.

2. **`CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW`**:
   - Used to create a temporary view for deduplicated data without modifying the original table until verified.

3. **`CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE`**:
   - Replaces the original table with the deduplicated data.

Replace `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, and `id_column` with the actual column names of your table. Adjust the `PARTITION BY` and `ORDER BY` clauses based on your requirements.
