# End-to-End Example of Amazon Aurora in Data Engineering

## Introduction
Amazon Aurora is a MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database engine from AWS, designed for high performance and availability. It integrates well with other AWS services, making it a powerful option for data engineering tasks such as data storage, processing, and analysis.

This guide will walk you through an end-to-end example of using Amazon Aurora in a data engineering pipeline, covering:
1. Setting up an Amazon Aurora instance.
2. Connecting to Aurora using Python.
3. Creating tables, inserting data, and querying data.
4. Integrating with an AWS Lambda function to automate a simple data-processing task.

## Prerequisites
1. **AWS Account** with access to create RDS instances.
2. **AWS CLI** and **Boto3** installed for command-line interactions and scripting.
3. **MySQL client** or **SQL Workbench** (optional) for connecting to the database manually.

## Step 1: Setting Up Amazon Aurora

### 1.1 Create an Aurora Database Cluster
1. **Go to the AWS RDS Console**: https://console.aws.amazon.com/rds/.
2. **Select "Create database"**.
3. Choose **Amazon Aurora** as the engine and select either the **MySQL** or **PostgreSQL-compatible** version.
4. In **Settings**, provide a **DB Cluster Identifier** (e.g., `my-aurora-cluster`).
5. **Master Username and Password**: Create a username and password (e.g., `admin` / `password123`).
6. **Instance Specifications**: Select the instance class and storage type according to your needs.
7. **VPC and Security Group**: Ensure the database is in a VPC and attach an appropriate security group that allows inbound access on port 3306 (MySQL default).

### 1.2 Enable Public Access (Optional)
If you need to connect to Aurora from outside of AWS, enable **public access** for the instance. Otherwise, ensure itâ€™s accessible within your VPC.

## Step 2: Connecting to Aurora Using Python and Boto3

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pymysql boto3
