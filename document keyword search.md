To efficiently perform fuzzy keyword matching across thousands of documents in Python, you‚Äôll want a solution that balances **speed** and **accuracy**. Here's a step-by-step guide with a highly efficient method using **RapidFuzz**, which is much faster than `fuzzywuzzy`.

### ‚úÖ Recommended Approach: Use `rapidfuzz` with multiprocessing

```python
from rapidfuzz import fuzz
from multiprocessing import Pool, cpu_count

def fuzzy_match(doc, keyword, threshold=80):
    # Return True if similarity score is above threshold
    return fuzz.partial_ratio(keyword.lower(), doc.lower()) >= threshold

def process_documents(docs, keyword, threshold=80):
    with Pool(cpu_count()) as pool:
        results = pool.starmap(fuzzy_match, [(doc, keyword, threshold) for doc in docs])
    return [doc for doc, matched in zip(docs, results) if matched]
```

### üöÄ Example Usage:

```python
docs = ["This is a test document.", "Another sample doc.", "Contains the keyword: optimization", ...]
keyword = "optimize"

matched_docs = process_documents(docs, keyword, threshold=80)
print(f"Matched {len(matched_docs)} documents.")
```

### ‚öôÔ∏è Performance Notes:

* **`fuzz.partial_ratio`** works well for matching substrings or misspelled keywords.
* `multiprocessing.Pool` accelerates processing by using all CPU cores.
* You can experiment with `fuzz.token_set_ratio` or `fuzz.ratio` for different types of matching behavior.
