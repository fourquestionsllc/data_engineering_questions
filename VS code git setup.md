The error **"could not clone your repository as git is not installed"** in VS Code typically means that Git is either not installed or VS Code is unable to detect it. Hereâ€™s how you can fix it:

### **Fix Steps:**
1. **Check if Git is Installed**
   - Open a terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~`) or Command Prompt/PowerShell and run:
     ```
     git --version
     ```
   - If Git is installed, it should return a version number like `git version 2.x.x`.  
   - If not, install Git from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

2. **Set Git Path in VS Code**
   If Git is installed but VS Code is not detecting it:
   - Open **VS Code**.
   - Go to **File > Preferences > Settings** (`Ctrl + ,`).
   - Search for `git.path` and set it to the correct Git binary path.  
     Example (Windows):  
     ```
     "git.path": "C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\git.exe"
     ```
     Example (Mac/Linux):
     ```
     "git.path": "/usr/bin/git"
     ```

3. **Install Git Plugin for VS Code**
   - Open **Extensions** (`Ctrl + Shift + X`).
   - Search for **"GitHub Pull Requests and Issues"** and install it (if you are working with Azure DevOps, you may also need the **Azure Repos** extension).

4. **Restart VS Code**
   - Close and reopen **VS Code** after making changes.

5. **Try Cloning Again**
   - Open **VS Code**.
   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + P`, then search for **"Git: Clone"**.
   - Enter your Azure DevOps repo URL (e.g., `https://dev.azure.com/your-org/your-project/_git/your-repo`).
   - Select a folder for cloning and proceed.

6. **Check Environment Variables (Windows)**
   If Git is still not detected:
   - Open **Run** (`Win + R`) and type `sysdm.cpl`, then go to the **Advanced** tab.
   - Click **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System Variables**, find `Path` and ensure it contains:
     ```
     C:\Program Files\Git\cmd
     ```
   - If not, add it manually and restart your computer.
