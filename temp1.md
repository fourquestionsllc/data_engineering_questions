Great ‚Äî since you're on **Windows** and want to **convert a PDF to images using PyMuPDF (a.k.a. `fitz`)** instead of `pdf2image`, here‚Äôs how you can do it in **Streamlit** using `PyMuPDF` to render a PDF page (e.g., first page) as an image:

---

### ‚úÖ Step-by-step: Convert and Display PDF Page as Image using PyMuPDF

```python
import streamlit as st
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
from PIL import Image
import io

# Path to the PDF file
pdf_path = "example.pdf"

# Open PDF with PyMuPDF
doc = fitz.open(pdf_path)

# Select the page you want (e.g., first page)
page = doc.load_page(0)  # 0-indexed

# Render page to a pixmap (raster image)
pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=fitz.Matrix(2, 2))  # matrix for 2x zoom

# Convert pixmap to PIL image
image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes("png")))

# Display in Streamlit
st.image(image, caption="Page 1 of PDF", use_column_width=True)
```

---

### üîÅ Optional: Loop through all pages (multi-page preview)

```python
for i in range(len(doc)):
    page = doc.load_page(i)
    pix = page.get_pixmap(matrix=fitz.Matrix(2, 2))
    image = Image.open(io.BytesIO(pix.tobytes("png")))
    st.image(image, caption=f"Page {i + 1}", use_column_width=True)
```

---

### üì¶ Installation (if not done yet)

```bash
pip install pymupdf pillow
```

No need for Poppler, so this works well on Windows.

Let me know if you want to render selectively (e.g., page N) or stream images for performance.
