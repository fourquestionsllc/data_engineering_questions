## Project Overview & Use Cases

The AI tool developed for Citigroup enables users to efficiently search and explore Tableau financial dashboards using multiple search methods, including keyword search, semantic search, and database search. This tool leverages LLMs (Large Language Models) to interpret user questions, identify relevant Tableau views, and deliver precise, contextually accurate responses.

Typical user questions include:

* "Show me the 2024 financial outlook for CBNA."
* "Bring me the dashboards for internal sales and external sales in 2023."
* "I want to see the 2024 plan of expense by businesses."
* "Give me the dashboards of ROA and ROE of 2024."
* "I am interested in the expenses by segments in 4Q23."
* "I am looking for views with tables with P1 to P9 metrics."

The tool supports the following search methods:

* **Keyword Search:** Extracts keywords from user questions and matches them against the text content of Tableau dashboards to locate the most relevant views.
* **Semantic Search:** Converts user questions into embedding vectors and searches against pre-computed embeddings of Tableau view summaries for a more nuanced match.
* **Database Search:** Translates user questions into SQL queries to retrieve structured data from the Tableau metadata database, including views, workbooks, data sources, and revisions.
