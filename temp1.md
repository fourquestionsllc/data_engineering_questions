That’s a common need for RAG/QA: you want all *useful* content, keep tables structured, and avoid duplicating text that’s already inside a table. Here’s a robust recipe (with code) using `pdfplumber` + optional `PyMuPDF` for ordering, which:

* Extracts tables with structure preserved (as markdown or TSV)
* Extracts the *remaining* text (non-overlapping with tables)
* Orders content in a reading-friendly sequence per page
* Outputs a single context string suitable to feed to an LLM

---

## Strategy Overview

1. **Open PDF with `pdfplumber`.** It gives you tables plus the raw text with bounding boxes.
2. **For each page:**

   * Extract table bounding boxes and serialize each table (e.g., as markdown).
   * Extract all words/lines, and **filter out** any text whose bbox overlaps significantly with any table bbox (to avoid duplication).
   * Sort the remaining text in logical reading order (top-to-bottom, left-to-right).
3. **Combine per-page content**: interleave “text before table / table / text after table” by comparing vertical positions.
4. **Produce a single string** where tables are represented in a structured way (e.g., markdown code block or TSV with markers) and non-table text is plain.

## Example Implementation

```python
import pdfplumber
from typing import List, Tuple
import itertools

def bbox_overlap(b1, b2, threshold=0.1) -> bool:
    # b: (x0, top, x1, bottom)
    x0_1, top_1, x1_1, bottom_1 = b1
    x0_2, top_2, x1_2, bottom_2 = b2

    # compute intersection area
    dx = min(x1_1, x1_2) - max(x0_1, x0_2)
    dy = min(bottom_1, bottom_2) - max(top_1, top_2)
    if dx <= 0 or dy <= 0:
        return False
    intersection = dx * dy
    area1 = (x1_1 - x0_1) * (bottom_1 - top_1)
    # if intersection is more than threshold fraction of the smaller bbox, consider overlap
    if intersection / area1 >= threshold:
        return True
    return False

def serialize_table(table: List[List[str]], table_index: int) -> str:
    # Convert table (list of rows) into markdown-like string preserving structure.
    if not table:
        return ""
    header = table[0]
    rows = table[1:]
    md = [f"--- Begin Table {table_index} ---"]
    # Markdown header
    md.append("| " + " | ".join(cell.strip() for cell in header) + " |")
    md.append("|" + "|".join(["---"] * len(header)) + "|")
    for row in rows:
        md.append("| " + " | ".join(cell.strip() for cell in row) + " |")
    md.append(f"--- End Table {table_index} ---\n")
    return "\n".join(md)

### Notes / Improvements

* **Better table bbox detection:** The above heuristics for table bounding boxes can miss or over-include; for precision, you can dig into `page.extract_table(...)` with `explicit_vertical_lines=True`/`explicit_horizontal_lines=True` or use `camelot` (PDF must be vector/native, not scanned).

* **Scanned PDFs:** If the PDF is scanned (no embedded text), first run OCR (e.g., via `pytesseract` on images from `pdf2image` or PyMuPDF rendering) and then apply table detection separately—OCR of tables is harder; tools like `DocTR` or `LayoutParser` can help.

* **Structured serialization:** You can swap markdown for a custom markup the LLM understands, e.g.:

  ```
  [TABLE id=3]
  col1 | col2
  ---- | ----
  a    | b
  [END TABLE]
  ```

* **Chunking for LLMs:** After building `context`, you might further split it into semantic chunks while preserving markers for tables if doing retrieval.

Would you like a version that:

* Outputs each piece as a JSON object with type `{"type": "text"|"table", "page": ..., "content": ...}` for vector ingestion?
* Handles scanned PDFs with OCR fallback automatically?
* Converts tables into structured embeddings-friendly representations (e.g., column headers + row maps)?
