The `poetry.lock` file is generated by **Poetry**, the Python dependency management tool, and it's created **based on the information in your `pyproject.toml` file**.

### Hereâ€™s how it works:

- The `**pyproject.toml**` file is where you manually define:
  - Your project metadata (name, version, etc.)
  - Your dependencies (e.g. `requests = "^2.31.0"`)
  - Your development dependencies (optional)

- When you run commands like:
  ```
  poetry install
  poetry update
  ```
  Poetry resolves the exact versions of the dependencies (including sub-dependencies) that satisfy the constraints in your `pyproject.toml`.

- It **writes this resolved dependency tree to the `poetry.lock` file**. This includes:
  - Exact versions
  - Dependency hashes
  - Dependency trees

This ensures reproducibility â€” so that anyone installing your project gets the exact same environment.

### TL;DR:
- âœ… `pyproject.toml` â€” you write this (defines constraints).
- ðŸ”„ `poetry.lock` â€” Poetry writes this (resolves exact versions).
