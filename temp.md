To display the contents of an Excel file from its binary data in a Jupyter notebook, follow these steps:

### ✅ Step-by-step Example

Suppose you already have the binary data in a variable called `binary_data` (of type `bytes`).

```python
import pandas as pd
from io import BytesIO

# Example: binary_data is already defined as bytes
# binary_data = b'...'

# Load the binary data into a pandas DataFrame
excel_file = BytesIO(binary_data)
df = pd.read_excel(excel_file)

# Show the DataFrame in the notebook
df.head()
```

### ✅ Optional: Multiple Sheets

If the Excel file contains multiple sheets and you want to see all of them:

```python
excel_file = BytesIO(binary_data)
xls = pd.ExcelFile(excel_file)

# Display all sheet names
print(xls.sheet_names)

# Load each sheet into a dictionary of DataFrames
dfs = {sheet: xls.parse(sheet) for sheet in xls.sheet_names}

# Show first sheet
dfs[xls.sheet_names[0]].head()
```

Let me know if you're reading the binary from an upload or a file — I can adjust the code.
