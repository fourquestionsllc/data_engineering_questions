Got it ✅ — you want to **undo the last commit** completely **both locally and remotely**, so that it’s as if that commit never happened.

Here’s how to do it safely step-by-step 👇

---

## 🧨 Step 1. Reset your local branch to the previous commit

```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

* This **removes** the last commit from your local branch
* And **discards all changes** made in that commit

⚠️ Make sure you **really don’t need** the changes — this is destructive.

---

## 🌐 Step 2. Force push the updated branch to remote

```bash
git push origin HEAD --force
```

or equivalently:

```bash
git push -f
```

This **overwrites the remote branch** to match your local branch — effectively removing the last commit from both local and remote.

---

## ⚠️ Important notes

* This **rewrites history**, so only do it if:

  * You’re the only one working on the branch **or**
  * Your team agrees to rewrite the branch history

* If others have already pulled the old commit, they’ll need to **reset or re-clone** to avoid conflicts.

---

## 🧱 Safer alternative (if you want to keep history clean)

If the commit is already shared and you want to **undo its effect** without rewriting history:

```bash
git revert HEAD
git push
```

That creates a **new commit** that undoes the last one — safe for shared branches.

Would you like me to show you how to **undo a specific commit (not just the last one)** in both local and remote too?
