Perfect â€” hereâ€™s a full example that:

1. Reads your `data` list (list of dicts).
2. Compares each itemâ€™s `"value"` field against a list `values_to_remove`.
3. Separates them into:

   * `filtered_data`: items with **no overlap**
   * `removed_data`: items **with overlap**
4. Saves both lists to `.json` files.

Hereâ€™s the code ðŸ‘‡

```python
import json

# Example data
data = [
    {"title": "Fruit", "value": ["apple", "banana"], "synonyms": ["fruits"]},
    {"title": "Snack", "value": ["banana", "chips"], "synonyms": ["snack food"]},
    {"title": "Drink", "value": ["water", "juice"], "synonyms": ["beverage"]}
]

# List of values to remove
values_to_remove = ["banana", "chips"]

# Separate data into filtered and removed
filtered_data = []
removed_data = []

for item in data:
    values = set(item.get("value", []))
    if values & set(values_to_remove):  # check overlap
        removed_data.append(item)
    else:
        filtered_data.append(item)

# Save to JSON files
with open("filtered_data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(filtered_data, f, indent=2)

with open("removed_data.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(removed_data, f, indent=2)

print("Filtered items saved to filtered_data.json")
print("Removed items saved to removed_data.json")
```

### âœ… What this does:

* `values & set(values_to_remove)` â†’ finds intersection between the two sets.
* If overlap exists â†’ item goes into `removed_data`.
* Otherwise â†’ item goes into `filtered_data`.
* Both lists are saved as formatted JSON (`indent=2` for readability).

Would you like to **add a comment/note** in the JSON file (e.g., why something was removed)? JSON doesnâ€™t support comments natively, but we can include a `"note"` field in each removed item if youâ€™d like.
