Perfect — you have a **Streamlit app** in `ui/app.py`, and it imports Python modules from your **current project directory** (e.g., sibling `.py` files).

Here’s exactly how to run it depending on your project layout 👇

---

## 🧩 Example project structure

```
my_project/
│
├── data_utils.py
├── model.py
│
└── ui/
    └── app.py
```

And inside `app.py` you might have:

```python
import streamlit as st
from data_utils import load_data
from model import predict
```

---

## ✅ Option 1. Run from the **project root** (recommended)

Navigate to your project’s root folder (where `ui/` lives) and run:

```bash
streamlit run ui/app.py
```

💡 Why:
This ensures that Python adds the **project root** to `sys.path`, so imports like `from data_utils import ...` work correctly.

---

## ⚙️ Option 2. Modify `sys.path` manually (if you must run inside `ui/`)

If you’re already in the `ui` directory and imports fail, you can add the parent directory to Python’s import path at runtime:

```python
# ui/app.py
import sys
import os
sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(__file__)))

import streamlit as st
from data_utils import load_data
from model import predict
```

Then you can run:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🧭 Option 3. Use a package-style import (if your project is a package)

If you’ve made `my_project` a package (i.e., it has an `__init__.py`), you can import relatively:

```python
from ..data_utils import load_data
```

and run Streamlit with the `-m` flag from the root:

```bash
python -m streamlit run ui/app.py
```

## ✅ Summary

| Situation                      | Command                             | Works With          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| You’re in project root         | `streamlit run ui/app.py`           | Most common         |
| You’re in `ui/` folder         | Add `sys.path` line                 | Quick fix           |
| You’ve structured as a package | `python -m streamlit run ui/app.py` | Clean modular setup |
