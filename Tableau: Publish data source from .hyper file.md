To upload and publish a `.hyper` file as a data source in Tableau using the REST API and Python, follow these steps:

---

## **Step 1: Authenticate with Tableau Server**
First, obtain an authentication token from Tableau Server.

```python
import requests

# Tableau Server details
TABLEAU_SERVER = "https://your-tableau-server.com"
USERNAME = "your-username"
PASSWORD = "your-password"
SITE_CONTENT_URL = ""  # Leave empty for default site

# API Endpoint for authentication
auth_url = f"{TABLEAU_SERVER}/api/3.15/auth/signin"

# Authentication payload
auth_payload = {
    "credentials": {
        "name": USERNAME,
        "password": PASSWORD,
        "site": {"contentUrl": SITE_CONTENT_URL}
    }
}

# Send authentication request
auth_response = requests.post(auth_url, json=auth_payload)
auth_data = auth_response.json()

# Extract the authentication token and site ID
TOKEN = auth_data["credentials"]["token"]
SITE_ID = auth_data["credentials"]["site"]["id"]
HEADERS = {"X-Tableau-Auth": TOKEN}
```

---

## **Step 2: Initiate File Upload**
Tableau requires file uploads to be done in chunks. First, create an upload session.

```python
# Initiate a new file upload session
upload_url = f"{TABLEAU_SERVER}/api/3.15/sites/{SITE_ID}/fileUploads"
upload_response = requests.post(upload_url, headers=HEADERS)
upload_session_id = upload_response.json()["fileUpload"]["uploadSessionId"]
```

---

## **Step 3: Upload the `.hyper` File**
Now, upload the `.hyper` file using a `PUT` request.

```python
from pathlib import Path

file_path = Path("data.hyper")

# Read the file and upload in chunks
with open(file_path, "rb") as f:
    upload_chunk_url = f"{TABLEAU_SERVER}/api/3.15/sites/{SITE_ID}/fileUploads/{upload_session_id}"
    requests.put(upload_chunk_url, headers=HEADERS, data=f)
```

---

## **Step 4: Publish the Data Source**
Once the file is uploaded, publish it as a new data source.

```python
# Define the data source name
DATASOURCE_NAME = "MyDataSource"

# Define the publish URL
publish_url = f"{TABLEAU_SERVER}/api/3.15/sites/{SITE_ID}/datasources"

# JSON payload for publishing
publish_payload = {
    "datasource": {"name": DATASOURCE_NAME},
    "uploadSessionId": upload_session_id,
    "overwrite": "true"  # Set to "false" if you don't want to overwrite an existing data source
}

# Send the request to publish
publish_response = requests.post(publish_url, headers=HEADERS, json=publish_payload)

# Print response
print("Publish Response:", publish_response.json())
```

---

## **Step 5: Sign Out (Optional)**
After the operation is complete, sign out to invalidate the authentication token.

```python
signout_url = f"{TABLEAU_SERVER}/api/3.15/auth/signout"
requests.post(signout_url, headers=HEADERS)
```

---

### **Summary**
1. Authenticate and get a session token.
2. Create an upload session.
3. Upload the `.hyper` file.
4. Publish it as a data source.
5. Sign out (optional).

This will successfully publish your `.hyper` file as a Tableau data source!
